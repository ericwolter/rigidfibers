# GPU Simulation of Rigid Fibers

This is the code and document for my masters's thesis. It includes a GPU-acclerated implementation of the numerical method "A numerical method for simulations of rigid fiber suspensions" by Anna Karin Tornberg and Katarina Gustavsson. I reduced the required runtime of 24h on a CPU to just 30min on a GPU.
