; Configuration file for python's ConfigParser based on Windows INI files
;
; Main difference to old format is the missing hard coded labels for exports and
; import files. Additionally variables now have defined names and are organized
; in sections to improve understanding and make parsing more robust as it
; doesn't have to rely on the specific position of each variable.
;
; The runner will read this file and convert into the respective constant header
; definitions used in Fortran and CUDA. This enables the compilers to generate
; more efficient code has all these variables can then be treated as constants
; during runtime, which enables optimization such as preprocessed calulation
; simplifications and loop unrolling
